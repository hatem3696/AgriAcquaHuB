Betta Fish, also known as Siamese Fighting Fish, is a popular freshwater fish for aquariums. They are known for their vibrant colors and flowing fins. Betta Fish are aggressive and territorial, so they should be kept in separate tanks or with other peaceful fish that won't provoke them. They require warm water and a varied diet to stay healthy.
